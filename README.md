# wuchang_opt
Small python app for determining best in slot armor for any need

You can try a web hosted version here: https://wuchang-opt.onrender.com/
It's a free hosting and notably slower, but it works if you can't use the exe release or python scripts.
(It's currently stuck at version 0.2, which only has chapter 1 gear in it because adding more makes it exponentially slower. I'll try to work on a solution.)
