# wuchang_opt
Small python app for determining best in slot armor for any need

You can try a web hosted version here: https://wuchang-opt.onrender.com/
It's a free hosting and notably slower, but it works if you can't use the exe release or python scripts.
Yes, the web app version DOES have all the armor in the game now. It is v0.5 as well.
I prefiltered the potential options in the web app version in a way that shouldn't effect results much but keeps the calculation time much lower
